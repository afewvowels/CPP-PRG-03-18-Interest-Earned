//  Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a
//  savings account after one year may be calculated as
//  Amount = Principal * (1 + (Rate / T))^T
//  Principal is the balance in the savings account, Rate is the interest rate, and T is
//  the number of times the interest is compounded during a year(T is 4 if the interest is
//  compounded quarterly).
//  Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times
//  the interest is compounded. It should display a report similar to:
//  Interest Rate:              4.25%
//  Times Compounded:           12
//  Principal:                  $1000.00
//  Interest:                   $43.34
//  Amount in Savings:          $1043.34
